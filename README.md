# defenseAnalysis
My final project for TMU's data analytics program. 

## Quick description:
I am an amateur data enthusiast. With this project, I aim to practice and apply what I've learned in my short time at TMU's Data Analytics program.

This projects aims to answer one simple question: "Does defense win titles?". 
This exploration will be done with respect to international cup football(aka soccer as I am typing this in Canada). 
I aim to use the publicly available Women's World Cup 2019 and Women's Euros 2022 data provided by StatsBomb (https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy) to look at the performances of the champions and possibly some lesser teams. With their performance, I aim to detect any patterns, correlations, or any sort of tell between defensive stats and their overall performance. 

The challenge with my project will be to create a robust defense measure in order to compare, contrast, and analyze the teams. 

## Influences:
I have gained inspiration and ideas from the following projects:
