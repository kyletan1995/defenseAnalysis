Plan: add Discussion/Conclusion + further research recommendations. Performance analysis (I need to figure out the Rsquared issue first).

### firstIteration
Files including firstIteration in their name are the datasets + rough work that's done to complete the first iteration of this project. 
This includes solely the defensive stats of the countries vs their opponents. [Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]

### secondIteration
Files in this folder and with the name secondIteration are the rough work + datasets done to complete the second portion of the project. 
This includes looking at the relative stats of how each team performes against their opponents. [Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]

### thirdIteration
Files in this fodler includes the rough work done in the regression analysis.
[Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]
