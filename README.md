# defenseAnalysis
My final project for TMU's data analytics program. 

## Quick description:
I am an amateur data enthusiast. With this project, I aim to practice and apply what I've learned in my short time at TMU's Data Analytics program.

This projects aims to answer one simple question: "Does defense win titles?". 
This exploration will be done with respect to international cup football(aka soccer as I am typing this in Canada). 
I aim to use the publicly available Women's World Cup 2019 data provided by FBREF (https://fbref.com/en/comps/106/2019/2019-Womens-World-Cup-Stats) to look at the performances of the champions and other successful teams. With their performance, I aim to detect any patterns, correlations, or any sort of tell between defensive stats and their overall performance. 

The challenge with my project will be to create a robust defense measure in order to compare, contrast, and analyze the teams. 

## Influences:
I have gained inspiration and ideas from the following projects: 
1. https://medium.com/datadream/predicting-epl-wins-a0d0cc5bcb18
2. https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/how-to-measure-defense/

## Files

### Roadmap
A very general, and very brief graphic description on my broad plans for this project. 

### Report[WIP]
The work in progress file of my written report. This will be updated as the project goes along.
As of 2/18/2023 this includes - Abstract, Literature review, Methodologies. 
Plan: add Discussion/Conclusion + further research recommendations. Performance analysis (I need to figure out the Rsquared issue first).

### firstIteration
Files including firstIteration in their name are the datasets + rough work that's done to complete the first iteration of this project. 
This includes solely the defensive stats of the countries vs their opponents. [Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]

### secondIteration
Files in this folder and with the name secondIteration are the rough work + datasets done to complete the second portion of the project. 
This includes looking at the relative stats of how each team performes against their opponents. [Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]

### thirdIteration
Files in this fodler includes the rough work done in the regression analysis.
[Kept historically to track previous progress, due to feeback this is irrevelant.]
