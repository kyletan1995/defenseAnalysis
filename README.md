# defenseAnalysis
My final project for TMU's data analytics program. 

## Quick description:
I am an amateur data enthusiast. With this project, I aim to practice and apply what I've learned in my short time at TMU's Data Analytics program.

### [Roadmap](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/roadmap.png)
A very general, and very brief graphic description on my broad plans for this project. 

## Files

### [database.sqlite](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)
This is the raw database that this project is based on. Due to size limitation (~300 MBs) I cannot upload this.
This is downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer

### [Python Pt I.ipynb](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Python%20Pt%20I.ipynb)
This is all the code and rough work for all analysis done during the "LITERATURE REVIEW + DATA DESCRIPTION" phase of the project.
This file also shows the initial reading in and subsetting of the data. 

### [Python Pt II.ipynb](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Python%20Pt%20II.ipynb)
This is all the code and rough work done for all the model building and analysis done in the "INITIAL RESULTS AND CODE" phase of the project.

### [R Workspace](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Rworkspace.R)
This shows my code and rough work for all analysis that was done on R during project. This includes outlier detection and removal, categorizing the output variables, and backward selection. 

### Database files
These are the various dataframes extracted, created, used, tinkered with during the project. 
- [numDataNew.csv](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/numDataNew.csv) - Dataframe containing all the numerical input variables, and both the numerical and cateogorized forms of the output variable. 
- [catDataNew.csv](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/catDataNew.csv) - Dataframe containing all the categorical input variables, and both the numerical and cateogorized forms of the output variable. 
- [ordDataNew.csv](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/ordDataNew.csv) - Dataframe containing the same details as catDatNew.csv, but the categorical input variables are converted into ordinals so that they can be put into algorithms that can't handle string inputs. 
- [combData2.csv](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/combData2.csv) - This is generated by joining ordDataNew.csv and numDataNew.csv. This dataframe contains both the numerical and categorical (in its ordinal format) input variables and both the numerical and cateogorized forms of the output variable. 

### EDA files
These are the EDA reports generated during the initial stages of the project. 
- [Initial NA Analysis](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Initial%20NA%20Analysis.html) - EDA on the output variable. This was used to look at the various betting odds variables and see if there's missing values, outliers and any other items to note. 
- [TeamAttr EDA](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/teamAttr%20EDA.html) - This is the report generated on the table in the database labelled 'team attributes'. This was used to determine the data types we're working with and any other standout items. 
- [catData](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/catData.html) - This is the report and analysis on all the team attributes that are categorical. Any correlations, outliers, missing values, and items to note will be detected here. 
- [numData](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/numData.html) - simlar to the catData report, this is the same but for the numerical data frame. 

### Decision Tree files
These files are the full decision trees generated from the model. As mentioned in the report, due to the sheer massive size of these decision trees. They're uplodaded separately should readers want to take a closer look. These decision trees are in text format, unless noted. 
- [decision_tree Defense.log](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/decistion_tree%20Defense.log) - Decision tree for defensive model.
- [decision_tree non-defensive.log](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/decistion_tree%20non-defensive.log) - Decision tree for non-defensive model. 
- [Full Decision Tree Baseline.log](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Full%20Decision%20Tree%20Baseline.log) - Decision tree for the baseline model. 
- [Full Deicision Tree Baseline.png](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Full%20Decision%20Tree%20Baseline.png) - Decision tree for the baseline model, in a graphical format. 

### [Excel Visualization.xlsx](https://github.com/kyletan1995/defenseAnalysis/blob/main/Excel%20Visualizations.xlsx)
This file shows the work to create the visualization on some of the graphics that are used in the report.
